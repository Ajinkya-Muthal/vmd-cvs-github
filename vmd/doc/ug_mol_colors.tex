\section{Coloring Methods}
\label{ug:topic:coloring}
\index{coloring!methods}

\VMD\ maintains a database of the colors used for the molecules and
other graphical objects which are visible in the display window.  It
keeps track of
\begin{itemize}
  \item color name definitions - its RGB value;
  \item mappings from a color category to color name - so residue name
MET is colored yellow
  \item the current color scale - red to white to blue, and several related parameters
\end{itemize}

\index{color!names}
\index{color!id}
There are 1057 colors available in VMD, with color ids ranging from 0 to
1056.  The first 33 are,
in order: blue, red, gray, orange, yellow, tan, silver, green, white,
pink, cyan, purple, lime, mauve, ochre, iceblue, black,
yellow2, yellow3, green2, green3, cyan2, cyan3, blue2, blue3, 
violet, violet2, magenta, magenta2, red2, red3, orange2, and orange3.

The next group of 1024 colors (from 33 to 1056) are colors used in
the color map, These can be set to one of
several ranges with the {\sf Color} window or the {\tt color} text command:
\index{window!color}
\index{color!window}
\index{color!command}
red$\rightarrow$green$\rightarrow$blue,
red$\rightarrow$white$\rightarrow$blue, or black$\rightarrow$white,
etc.  There are no names for the specific colors.  The color map will
be discussed in more detail in a section to follow.


\subsection{Color categories}
\label{ug:topic:color:categories}
\index{color!category}

\VMD\ maintains a database of the colors used for the molecules and the
other graphical objects in the display window.  The database consists
of several color {\em categories}; each color
category contains a list of names, and each name is assigned a color.
For example, there is a Resname color category, and within this
category there are many names; one for each of the available residue
names.  Some of these are {\tt ALA}, {\tt CYS}, and {\tt PRO}.  Each
name can be assigned a color from a list of 33 available colors called
the \index{color map}{\it color map}.  The RGB value of each color can
be modified directly in the
\hyperref{{\sf Color} window}{{\sf Color} window [\S}{]}{ug:ui:window:color}.
To color items in a gradation manner,
there are additional 1024 colors used in the
\hyperref{color scale}{color scale [\S}{]}{ug:topic:coloring:scale}.

The different color categories in \VMD\ are listed in table
\ref{table:ug:colorcats}.  The {\sf Color} window\index{color!window}
\index{window!color}
can be used to change the assignment
of colors to the names in each of these categories.  For example, to
change the color used to draw Arginine residues when molecules are
colored by residue, you would use the {\sf Color} window, select the `Resname'
category, select the `Arg' name there, and then pick the color to use
for Arginine's from the list of colors next to the names.

\subsection{Coloring Methods}
\label{ug:topic:coloring:methods}
\index{coloring!methods}

As described in chapter \ref{ug:topic:drawing}, each representation
for a molecule has a specific {\em coloring method}.  The coloring
method determines how the color for each atom in the representation
(view) is determined.  These different methods use the colors assigned
to the names in the categories listed above, and use those names to
color the atoms.  Molecular drawing methods which also draw the bonds
between atoms will always color each half of the bond separately,
using the color of the nearest atom for each half.  
Table~\ref{table:ug:colormethods} lists the different coloring methods
available.  The description for each method explains the source of
the information used to determine the color.

\begin{table}[htb]
  \hspace{0.7in}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
    \multicolumn{1}{|c}{Method} &
        \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Description} \\ \hline\hline
    Name	& Atom name, using the Name category \\
    Type	& Atom type, using the Type category \\
    ResName	& Residue name, using the Resname category \\
    ResType	& Residue type, using the Restype category \\
    ResID	& Residue identifier, using the resid mod 16 for the color \\
    Chain	& The one-character chain identifier,
			using the Chain category \\
    SegName	& Segment name, using the Segname category \\
    Molecule	& Molecule all one color, using the Molecule category \\
    Structure	& Helix, sheet, and coils are colored differently \\
    ColorID	& Use a user-specified color index (from 0 to 15) \\
    Beta	& Color scale based on beta value of the PDB file \\
    Occupancy	& Color scale based on the occupancy field of the PDB file \\
    Mass	& Color scale based on the atomic mass \\

\subsection{Coloring by color categories}
\label{ug:topic:coloring:categories}
\index{color!category}
\index{coloring!by category}

The default method is to color by the atom name.  The way it works is
that there is a color category called `Name' which contains a list of
all the atom names (e.g., CA, N, O5', and H) that have been loaded into
\VMD.  Each name is assigned one of the 16 main colors (e.g., cyan, blue, red,
and white).  When the drawing representation needs a color for a
specific atom, it looks in the appropriate color category and finds
that CA is colored cyan, N is blue, and so on.

Most of the coloring methods are based on color categories, so
coloring by `ResName' colors each residue name differently, `SegName'
colors each segment differently, and so on.  The mapping between a
given item in a color category and a color can be changed using the
\hyperref{{\sf Color} window}{{\sf Color} window [\S}{]}{ug:ui:window:color}.
\index{color!window}
\index{window!color}
This allows users to make atoms with the name CA be black and the
residue CYS be yellow.  Some attention was given to making the colors
reasonable, so that oxygens are red, nitrogens blue, sulphur and
cysteines yellow, etc.

\subsection{Color scale}
\label{ug:topic:coloring:scale}
\index{color!scale}
\index{coloring!by color scale}

Several of the coloring methods, including `Beta', `Charge', and
`Occupancy', describe a range of floating point values rather than a
set of names.  These are colored via the {\em color scale}, which is a
list of 1024 smoothly changing colors.  There are many color gradations
available.  All of them consist of transformations of three colors.
For instance, ``RGB'' colors the smallest value red, values near the
middle of the scale are green, and the largest values are blue.
Colors in-between are linear mixes of the two colors.  The list of 
available gradations is given below.


\begin{table}[htb]
  \hspace{0.7in}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
    \multicolumn{1}{|c}{Method} &
        \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Description} \\ \hline\hline
    RGB		& small=red,   middle=green, large=blue \\
    BGR		& small=blue,  middle=green, large=red \\
    RWB		& small=red,   middle=white, large=blue \\
    BWR		& small=blue,  middle=white, large=red \\
    RWG		& small=red,   middle=white, large=green \\
    GWR		& small=green, middle=white, large=red \\
    GWB		& small=green, middle=white, large=blue \\
    BWG		& small=blue,  middle=white, large=green \\
    BlkW	& small=black, large=white \\
    WBlk	& small=white, large=black \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}

\end{table}


The minimum of the range of values is linearly scaled and shifted to
start at 0 and end at 1.  Assume the color scale is RGB.  For a given
value of x in the scale range [0..1], the RGB value is found first
from a linear scaling based on the midpoint.
If x $=$ 0, R is 1 (for maximum red).  This continues linearly until x
$=$ midpoint, at which point, R is 0 and stays 0.
The green component is 0 at both x $=$ 0 and x $=$ 1 and is 1 at the
midpoint.  Linear scaling occurs in between.
The blue component is 0 for x $<=$ midpoint, and 1 for x $=$ 1.

contributions of each color, and the resulting colors are on the bottom.}
{fig:ug:color_scale}
\begin{rawhtml}
</CENTER>
\end{rawhtml}

An additional term, ``min'', is added to each of the component terms
before they are merged.  This shifts the final colors more towards
white or black.  Min can take on values from -1 to 1.

scale caused by the value of ``min''.}

</CENTER>
\end{rawhtml}

There is only one color scale used at a time so it is impossible to
display objects colored by multiple different color scales.

\subsection{Materials}
\label{ug:topic:coloring:materials}

\VMD\ allows users to apply a materials property to the
molecular models they create.  The material determines such things
as how transparent an object is, or how shiny, or how large the specular 
reflections are.   
Making objects semi-transparent is a potentially powerful means of
viewing multiple layers of the molecule simultaneously.  Imagine a
protein on the surface of, and extending part way into, a membrane.
One way to visualize the extent of the penetration is to represent the
lipids as `Bonds' and make them transparent.  That will show the
membrane without completely obstructing the view of the protein.

\VMD\ maintains a database of materials which can be applied to any
representation in the system, much like the database for colors.  There
are two default materials, "Opaque" and "Transparent", which cannot be
modified.  Each material is defined by five settings, as follows: 
material is 

\begin{itemize}
\item Opacity: a number (0.0 to 1.0) describing the transparency;
            1 is solid, 0 is transparent. By default, transparent objects 
	    are drawn with Opacity set to .3

\item Ambient: a value describing how strongly the material reflects 
            ambient light.  Ambient light
            provides a uniform illumination of objects with a
            background lighting of the object color. 
\item Diffuse: Diffuse reflections are independent of the viewing
            direction, but depend on the direction of the light source
            with respect to the surface of the displayed object.
\item Specular: a number describing the intensity of
             specular reflections. Produces highlights, the higher the 
	     value, the smaller and the brighter the highlight.
\item Shininess: a number describing how large is the angle of
              the specular reflections. The smaller the number the
              wider the angle and the more shiny objects appear.
              Default corresponds to a Phong exponent of 40.
\end{itemize}
For details regarding these material properties, consult an elementary
graphics book such as Foley \& Van Dam (Computer Graphics).
